* NOTE:
- since, no proper API was provided, I had to use a free API which gives the response with some random products.
- And then i had to use that API in order to fetch some details of products since there is no free API for properties that i could find.
- Since, ffree APIs have limitations, the only filter i could apply was search by title. But if there is proper API created in the bakcend, then i can apply filters by date range, price range, category, guest list, etc.


** FEATURES:
- SSR for better SEO.
- Filter products through title
- Loading UI for better user Experience
- Lazy Loading on Images.
